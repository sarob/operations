Subject: RE: MSST folks

I pushed the research track info  to  storage-research-list Garth and I started eons ago which is extremely broad.  It should show up by tomorrow.


If anyone has heard a great keynote lately let me know and I can let the invited chairs know.

Last year we had Margo Seltzer and Mark Kryder which was tricky because he is retired and we had to get him access

to info via Mark Re.  Those keynotes went over extremely well I think. 

Recently we had Kim Keeto (HPE the machine), Jeff Bonwick (ZFS/DSSD), Scotty Miller (Dreamworks), Peter Braam (Lustre), etc.

I might ask Dave Patterson, although he turned me down last time, something about having to work for a living at Google now J
 

Right now looks like one day of the invited track might be computational storage.  Ha, wonder if I shouldn’t ask Eric Reidel since he did

some of the first work on the topic for his thesis way back then J  that might be pretty cool to get his perspective on why computational storage

will make it economically this time or not J.  We have quite a few names for talks on this topic from fpga fronting devices to protocols (NVME exentions,

to  programming models like streams oriented methods for how you contemplate programming distributed compute in network and storage.

 The other day may be a bit of a mix, potentially an update

on user space file systems, maybe a media update since we do that about every other year, and curation which is becoming a big deal now that

everyone wants to be a data scientist J  Maybe a data curation as a career keynote…

That’s a glimpse but its still pretty drafty.


Wondering how the tutorial day is coming?  I see this new StorageOS thing that takes Kubernetes and some various condiments and makes

a distributed storage system out of it is a possibility?  We could do a tutorial on GUFI if that would help, open src file/storage system metadata indexing, you may

not use GUFI but you may care about the ins and outs of storage system metadata indexing.


Well, I am feeling better now, glad I kicked the chairs (haha)  J

Hi Sean,

I took the liberty and approached Patrick (the CephFS project lead, in CC) about the possibility of
running a CephFS tutorial. Patrick kindly expressed interest in running a tutorial (thanks again Patric!),
hence I'm putting you guys in touch. Could you please give Patrick the details on how the tutorial day
works, some guidelines on the tutorial content, etc?

Cheers,
Michal
