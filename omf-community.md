# Open Mobility Foundation

# Urban Computing Foundation (UCF)
* Keeping track of the competition (future partner?)
* github org https://github.com/ucfoundation
* some information on their website, but very limited https://uc.foundation/
* Most of the [planning and discussion happens in their TC meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ScXoO3urg-iOB26OSvz4VjMR2SNVLd-aA8yhgvvq8Bs/edit#)

# 12 Priorities
1. OMF developer summits with admin/community run tracks and project meetings. Administration organizes the space, food, headcount. Members can have expo hall space and meeting rooms. Provide a forum for strategic headliner talks. Get the membership excited to be a part of the momentum. John Ellis interest. 
    1. First step on creating a marketplace. 
1. Documentation as a project. I have been involved in this type of project before and can help. Underway for mds-core. Turn into long term effort.
1. Product Management and Architecture Landscape development as a project. It’s appears to be four documents jammed together. Product strategy, technology architecture, development process and project roadmap. As a public project, we can make headway much faster.
1. OMF train releases on a 3-6 month schedule. I believe this is the highest priority for Lacuna. Geoff Arnold interest.
1. Public project roadmap with milestones and features
1. Start holding face to face project meetings for at least next release planning. I would recommend that the maintainers and co-chairs plan this without waiting for the foundation. I have done these public retro/planning meetings before and can help.
1. Business Development: Find new members for sponsorship and contribution. Build a integration process to make them marketing or development contributors. Geoff Arnolds interest.
1. Community Management: Find new users and operators. Build a integration process to teach them how to install, maintain, patch, and upgrade mds-core. 
1. Build a user forum for the users and operators to self help. Make it search crawlable.
1. I would like to work on projects with Seleta Reynolds LA DOT. 
    1. Privacy, permitting, UCF, and general getting along with Uber
    2. Teaching open source office operations to the OMF BoD and users
1. Create a user committee. Surveys the community for user problems and how well OMF to contributing to making solutions. Marketing volunteers from the membership and community. 
1. Create a infrastructure wg. Would manage GitHub org admin, web site, chat, mailing lists, calendar, CI tooling/software pipeline, and release process. Couple of paid leaders, rest volunteers from the membership and community.
    1. Second step on creating a marketplace
